### Introducing Html5-boilerplate Kickstart Less
I fondly refer to this effort as the Boiler Kick Less Project ;-)
* **HTML5 Boilerplate** (http://html5boilerplate.com/)is a wonderful combination of best practices for HTML5 and CSS3. According to their website, HTML5 Boilerplate is the web’s most popular front-end template which helps you build fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites. They say you can "kick-start" your project with the combined knowledge and effort of 100s of developers, all in one little package.
* **HTML5 Kickstart** (http://www.99lime.com/elements/) on the other hand includes Ultra–Lean HTML5, CSS, & JS Building Blocks for Rapid Website Production:

### Your help needed
If you are very experienced with HTML5 CSS3 and either HTML5 Boilerplate or HTML5 Kickstart we could really use your help. What we would like to do is to create a tool that will merge specific portions of the two projects together somewhat automatically, that way we can ensure that this project stays up to date with the two other projects. So if you are knowledgeable in this kind of a merge project, and more specifically automating the merge so that the project stays up to date that would also be a huge asset. We could really use your feedback on what parts should be included and what should be opted out from each project. Initially, we will be trying to see where there is overlap and which project has a better offering in that department and opting out weaker features for better ones with the goal of bringing to the table the "best of both worlds".

### Authors and Contributors
I would like to thank the HTML Boilerplate and HTML Kickstart teams, and the teams of the other open source projects that are making this project possible. Their hard work and faithful contribution to the community of web designers and all those who benefit from their innovation is a testimony to the human spirit to reach out and help others succeed. Thank you and God bless you for your efforts.
